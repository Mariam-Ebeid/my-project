            The evolution of human sexuality is one of the most debated scientific issues, and while Darwin's theory of evolution is the most famous in this field, it has not settled the matter. Undoubtedly, the search for the unknown always arouses curiosity and the love of knowledge in humans in general, and researchers and scientists in particular. From this standpoint, many researchers in various fields, such as medicine, sociology, and linguistics, are passionate about researching the origin and evolution of humans, whether in themselves or in comparison with other beings.
            Driven by this desire, Dr. Ahmed El Batrawy, an anatomist, embarked on presenting his vision of human evolution to the Arabic reader, using the science of anatomy to compare humans with other creatures, especially modern humans' close relatives, the great apes. The author then discusses the inhabitants of Egypt from prehistoric times to modern times, and the brilliance of ancient Egyptians in the field of anatomy and the extent of their contribution to its development.</div>

        Ahmed Mahmoud El Batrawy, an Egyptian physician and advocate for Arabizing sciences, was born in 1902 in Al-Minufiyah. Graduating from Kasr Al Ainy in 1926, he later became the first Egyptian head of the Anatomy Department there. El Batrawy championed teaching medicine in Arabic and contributed significantly to translating medical texts, earning a place in the Arabic Language Academy. He was a prolific author, with works including "Evolution of Human Sexuality" and "On the Margins of Medical History." Dr. Ahmed El Batrawy's scientific contributions span anatomy, anthropology, and Arabic language advocacy, leaving a lasting legacy upon his death in 1964.

            All living organisms on Earth are composed of cells. The cell is the simplest unit of life, and the vast majority of life forms on Earth consist of single-celled microbes. Each cell resembles a chemical factory of astonishing complexity, the intricacies of which we have only begun to unravel in the last fifty years or so, using modern techniques such as microscopy, biochemistry, and molecular biology.

            In this book from the 'Very Short Introduction' series, Terrence Allen and Graham Caughley explore the nature of cells, from their basic structure to their various forms, division, differentiation from highly flexible stem cells, and finally programmed cell death. Cells are the fundamental building blocks of life, and understanding them and how they work is pivotal to all branches of medicine and biology.</div>

            Quantum mechanics and our theories about time, space, symmetry, and thermal physics - and their strange effects on philosophical concepts; a deeper understanding of these theories aids physics by paving the way for new theories and applications, while philosophy helps explore what changes should occur in our worldview, based on what we learn from physics. This book, part of the "Very Short Introduction" series, addresses the fundamental topics in the philosophy of physics through three main axes: the nature of time, space, and motion; the emergence of non-reversible behavior in statistical mechanics; and the discussion of quantum theory, which serves as the foundation for much of modern physics; yet, it remains mysterious to this day.</div>

                The remarkable achievements of modern chemistry would not have been possible without passing through previous stages undertaken by a large battalion of dedicated scientists whose goals were unified to benefit humanity and its prosperity. Our discussion of chemistry leads us to mention the efforts of Arab scientists such as "Jabir ibn Hayyan" (whom the West dubbed as the father of chemistry), "Al-Farabi," and "Ibn Sina," among others. They steered chemistry away from the myths of sorcery and magic, and the fantastical notions spread by some ancient philosophers — like their belief in the existence of a "philosopher's stone" that could transform base metals into gold — which associated it with magic and astrology. They authored numerous substantial books in which they documented their experiments and opinions, many of which coincided with modern discoveries and theories in chemistry, and sometimes even preceded them.

            Starting with the Babylonians who integrated mathematics into their study of astronomy, the 
            author Ian Stewart traces the evolution of human understanding of the universe. After centuries
            of misunderstanding the nature of the Earth as the center of the cosmos, Copernicus introduced 
            his revolutionary idea of the sun's centrality, stating that the Earth is just an ordinary planet 
            orbiting it. Kepler further developed this cognitive structure and formulated the laws of planetary motion,
            which later led Newton to devise his theory of gravity.
            Centuries later, slight deviations in Mercury's motion inspired 
            Einstein to formulate the theory of general relativity, and the concept of the singularity 
            led to the proposal of other additions such as cosmic inflation, dark matter, and dark energy.
            But do these theories suffice to explain the structure of the universe? Does dark matter truly exist?

She begins her book by defining black holes and explaining their nature and formation, elucidating the concept of spacetime fabric and its relation to black holes. She then highlights the prominent features that distinguish one black hole from another, such as mass and angular momentum, shedding light on what happens to matter when it falls into a black hole. She proceeds to explain the concept of the "entropy" of black holes and their thermodynamic properties and processes, demonstrating how to measure their weight. The book concludes with a review of the reasons that drive us to study black holes, and their secondary effects that extend beyond their surrounding environment, reaching as far as the planet Earth.

            In the public imagination, artificial intelligence is on the verge of reaching a dangerous stage that threatens not only jobs and human relationships but the very civilization itself. In this groundbreaking book, Stuart Russell — a renowned researcher in the field of artificial intelligence — argues that this frightening scenario can be avoided, but only if we completely rethink the field of artificial intelligence.
            Russell begins his book by exploring the idea of intelligence in humans and machines, listing the developments that must occur in the field of artificial intelligence before we reach superintelligent AI. He also discusses the ways in which humans are already misusing artificial intelligence, from deadly autonomous weapons to viruses, and emphasizes that if the expected developments occur and superintelligent AI emerges, we will have created entities much more powerful than us humans. So, how can we ensure that these entities do not have sovereignty over us? How can we ensure that those machines remain obedient and committed to achieving our goals as humans, without having any self-serving objectives? How can we avoid the terrifying conflict between humans and machines portrayed in Hollywood movies and science fiction novels, and maintain our civilization while remaining masters of our destinies?

            Our fascination with dinosaurs seems to be never-ending; an fascination bolstered by movies and documentaries that claim to portray these creatures with such accuracy that they bring them back to life. But to what extent can we trust the image painted by these films of dinosaurs, and how close is it to reality? Do they truly reflect new discoveries or the latest research in the world of dinosaurs?
            In this engaging book, David Norman reveals how scientists have combined anatomy, genetics, forensic science, and even engineering design to form a picture of the shape, diet, movement, and interactions of dinosaurs. By exploring the evolution of animal life on Earth, the author sheds light on the place of dinosaurs in evolutionary history.

            How do fossils support the theory of evolution? What is the concept of "living fossils"? And what kind of fossils will the present generation leave behind? Fossils have not always been easy to understand; there have long been doubts about their nature and significance, and sometimes their mere existence has threatened prevailing views on the origin of life and the age of the Earth. Drawing on the latest scientific interpretations, Keith Thomson connects fossils to our lives in a practical and realistic context, shedding light on their impact on mythology, philosophy, our concept of time, and popular culture. This engaging book from the "A Very Short Introduction" series provides a distinctive and comprehensive explanation of fossils as a phenomenon.
